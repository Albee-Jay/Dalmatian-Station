			<h3>Here is our Family Story ...</h3>
			<div class="dent">
				Our family has been together over the span of 30 years. While all four of us are brothers, we've each come into the family at different times in life. Papa Tom <i><small>(he was our first human)</small></i>, <a href="chip.html">Mr. Chips</a>, Daddy Albert <i><small>(our second human)</small></i>, <a href="bizz.html">Bizzmarq</a>, <a href="max.html">Max</a> and <a href="lou.html">Louis.</a> That's Our Family. Please click our names to read our stories and see our pictures. You're gonna love how cute we are.

			<h3>Are Dalmatians good dogs for everyone?</h3>
				<div class="dent">
					That is an extremely important question. We think it greatly depends on how much time, patience, and love our potential humans have to offer to us. Dalmatians are very loving, caring and devoted to their humans; but some humans don't have the kind of attention that some Dals can and do need. We are full of energy and we love to play, but once in a while we Dals don't know when to stop. Most times it's because we love having fun with our humans who seem to run out of energy before we do, so when we stay in high energy and excited mode; some humans can get mad at that.
					<blockquote>
						"I wish they would have never made those <i><b>'101 Dalmatians'</b></i> live action movies!" Bizz says he overheard Daddy Albert once say, "It only glamorized Dals and made people and children think that's how they behave and when they don't, people get angry at those poor dogs." 
					</blockquote>
					To tell the truth there are a lot of ups and downs living with some Dalmatians. We are very easy to 'spot' because of our pretty spotted coats, which seems to make humans happy to see us and we like that. We only wish more humans would learn how to give us the love we deserve, because Dals always give back so much more than we receive. Just ask Papa Tom and Daddy Albert.
