					<h3>Hello, my name is Louis ...</h3>

							<p>Like my brother <a href="max.html">Max</a>, my humans found me at a Dalmatian rescue. I also had a very bumpy start to my life too, like my brother <a href="bizz.html">Bizz</a>, I had four different homes by the time I was a one year old.<br><br>I was from a divorced home and they gave me up, in another home I was in fights all the time and in yet another home tiny humans would hit me so much that I got mad and then the big humans hit me too and sent me away.</p>

							<p>My foster parents took me for a ride one day to a strange house with two humans and another Dalmatian like me, who seemed really nice. They had a great big yard and I got to run and play with the Dal who lived there and his name was <a href="max.html">Max</a>. Then, I heard my foster parents talking about me the two humans we came to visit.</p>
							<blockquote>
								"Louis really is a great little guy. He has a lot of energy and is full of a lot of life. He has had some trouble with past owners but none of that was really his fault.", my foster mom told the humans. "One home went through a divorce, one home fought him because he is strong and aggressive, and his last home gave him up because they said he was aggressive toward their children, but tbey failed to mention that the children would hit him all the time."<br><br>"Oh wow, that is awful! He is still only a baby.", said the black haired man, "How could those people be so mean to such a cute dog?" "I think he great too. If I can get him belly up," said the tall man, "then maybe, he'll be a good fit for our family." 
							</blockquote>
							<p>I heard my foster mom call my name so I went inside the house to see what she wanted. The tall man bent down to rub my head and then whoa, he flipped me over to rub my belly; it felt really good so I wagged my tail. The man smiled at he and it made me feel good.<br><br>Then my forster parents put my leash back on me and we left to go home. A little while later, a week I think, the two humans came to my house to see me. They said they wanted me to come live with them. And just like that I had a brand new family and home.</p>
