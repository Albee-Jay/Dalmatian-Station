The Dalmatian Station ... a personal project

This project "The Dalmatian Station", is a personal one for me; it's about our 4 Dalmatian babies over the years.

See it live here: https://albee-jay.github.io/Dalmatian-Station/

After I built my first website following the lead of the course at Gateway Technical College, we were tasked to build another website for ourselves; using what we learned in class.

I chose to build a website about our Dalmatians.

With alot of HTML and some CSS I built multiple pages, added images, clickable links, an audio, a video and a couple of alerts (I wonder if you'll notice them). I am proud of the work I did here but I am also aware that it still needs work with the CSS and the images.

I welcome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better.

Thank You, Albee-Jay
