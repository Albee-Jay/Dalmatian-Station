					<h3>Hi, I'm Bizzmarq ...</h3>
						<div class="dent">
							<div class="bio">
								<p>Boy oh boy, did I have a rough start in life right from the beginning. I was born on a farm in a very big litter, I had six brothers and sisters total and then there was me. All the humans made such a big deal over my siblings, about how big their paws were and how they were all gonna grow up to be big and strong.<br><br>But ME, they said I was a runt, the smallest dog they ever saw in a litter of puppies. I had small feet, almost no spots and a short snout. I was the literal little brother. Honestly, I think the only thing I was missing was something like a bright red nose, I heard about some other guy everybody else made fun of too.</p>

					<h3>Finding a New Home and Love ...</h3>
					<div class="dent">
						<div class="bio">
							<p>Just like all the humans said to me my whole life (I was just weeks old, I couldn't tell time yet), one by one my siblings were picked for new homes with new humans who would love them. But ME, no one looked at me twice and it made me sad. Finally I was all alone, all my brothers and sisters were gone, they all had new homes and new humans but no one wanted me.</p>
								<blockquote>
									"Albert, wake up ... Albert, wake up, I have something for you! Happy Anniversary!" I was sleeping when a loud noise woke me up, I was scared and shaking, I didn't know what was happening. These two humans I never saw before were passing me around like a toy. "Oh my God, Tom is this puppy for me?!" said the skinny human with long black hair while he was holding me and staring at me.<br><br>"Yes, the farm where I got him said he was the last one and the runt of the litter," said the tall man with glasses and gray hair, "but I told them that he was perfect, just what I was looking for!" The skinny one kept hugging and kissing me, that made me feel so good. And just like that, I had new humans, they loved me and we were a family." 
								</blockquote>
							<p>If you think that this is the happy ending to sad story, guess again. I have one more rotten story to tell you and this one is a doozy.<br><br>The very next morning in my new home I was surprised to find a giant monster lived there too. His name was <a href="chip.html">Chip</a>, the humans said, and they told him to be nice to me. That made me feel good.<br><br>So, I started walking around my new house and it was so big. I found some funny round rubber things on the floor in the living room, they moved and bounced, they made me feel happy. I started to play with the one I found, when I got the shock of my life.<br><br>That giant monster bit me on my ear! He poked a hole in my ear! I starting screaming and running through the house like a mad dog. My Daddy Albert came running from the kitchen into the dining room to see what happened. I was still screaming running up some stairs and then back down when my Daddy Albert found me.<br><br>"What's wrong my little love? What happened?" asked my Daddy Albert while he held me, and I was crying and shaking.<br><br>Then that mean giant monster Chip came over to where we sitting on the stairs and I started to cry again and shake even more. Daddy shouted at Chip, "Go on Chip. Go lay down!" Papa Tom came in from the kitchen asking what happened. "Chip bit the baby's ear. He poked a hole right through it!", said Daddy Albert.<br><br>Both of the humans yelled at the giant monster to go away and he did. That was the day that I knew my new human Daddy Albert loved me and I loved him right back, he was MY human.</p>
