					<h3>Hi, I'm Max ...</h3>
					<div class="dent">
						<div class="bio">
							<p>I was a part of a Dalmatian Rescue, when my humans saw me online and came to visit me at my foster home. They seemed nice enough, but I liked the taller gray haired man right away.<br><br>He gave me belly rubs as soon as he got close enough to pet me. The other human approached with another Dal, who I didn't know, they seemed okay. So, the tall gray haired man, whose name was Tom; adpoted me so I had a brand new family and home.</p>

					<h3>Getting Into Trouble ...</h3>
					<div class="dent">
						<div class="bio">
							<p>I tried to bite one of my humans in the face. I was living with my new family for quite a few months by this time and it was a regular everyday kind of day. We were in the family room watching tv and relaxing. Me, my brother <a href="bizz.html">Bizz</a> and the other human were sitting on the floor. And then that's when the spit hit the fan!</p>
								<blockquote>
									"Oh My God!", the human next to me screamed and covered his face with his hands. Yelling through his fingers he shouted, "I don't know what happened! We were all sitting here on the floor, I turned to give Max a hug and he tried to bite my face!" My Papa Tom sayng, "I saw him, he almost had his whole mouth over your face from your chin to the bridge of your nose and then you screamed."
								</blockquote>
							<p>Hard lessons were learned that day ... for all of us. I learned never to harm Bizz's human ALbert. He learned never to touch me again. And, Bizz learned to keep a better eye on his human becuase I didn't like him and now we all knew it. In the end, me amnd my human Papa Tom made up but things were not the same anymore.</p>
