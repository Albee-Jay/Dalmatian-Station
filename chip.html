					<h3>Howdy, I'm Mr. Chips ...</h3>

							<p>I was the first Dalmatian to kick start our family, I was three years old at the time. I used to live with an elderly woman and two other dogs, a black lab and I don't remember the other one.<br><br>She was a nice lady who loved us but then one day she wasn't so nice and it was really scary.<br><br>Then the lady's daughter came over to say that the lady had to move and we couldn't go with her. I didn't know what was going to happen to us.</p>

					<h3>Hooray for Papa Tom!</h3>

						<div class="bio">
							<p>I was still living with the elderly lady when a man came over to our house to visit with us. The lady told him about me and he wanted to see me. By this time it was only me and the lady left, my roommate, the black lab, moved away and I never saw him again.</p>
								<blockquote>
									""Hi Tom, please come in. Can I offer you something to drink?" the lady said to the man. "No thank you, I'm fine. Is that the dog, Mr. Chips? He's a very handsome dog!" as soon as I heard the man say that about me, I ran right up to him so we could meet each of other. The man said, "he seems like a very happy dog." "Oh he sure is and a good dog too. I'm going to be sad to see him go, but I can't take him with me. They don't allow pets in my new building." the lady said. "Well, don't you worry about Mr. Chips, I'm going to give him a good home and I promise to take good care of him!", and just like that I had a new human, Papa Tom." 
								</blockquote>
							<p>I moved in with Papa Tom on that same day he came to the lady house's for a visit. For a while it was just me and Papa Tom living a good life. Then one day Papa Tom brought another human home to visit me, his name was Albert. Right off the bat he was very nice to me, he flipped over on my back and gave me a good belly rub. Papa Tom told me that Albert was going to live with us forever. And just like that I had another new human and we were a family.</p>
